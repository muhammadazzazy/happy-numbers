# Happy Numbers
This is a Python implementation for a program that checks whether a positive integer entered by the user is a happy number. The definition of a happy number is as follows:
1. Take an arbitrary positive integer.
2. Calculate the sum of the squares of its digits.
3. Replace the number with the sum calculated in step 2.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 until the sum is equal to 1.
5. If the sum of the square of its digits never reaches 1, the number is not a happy number. Otherwise, the number is a happy number.

This program requires Python 3 which can be installed from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

To start the program, run the following command:
```bash
python3 main.py
```
The project idea was obtained from [karan/Projects#numbers](https://github.com/karan/Projects#numbers).
